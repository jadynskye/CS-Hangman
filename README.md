# 🕹️ CS-Hangman Game for Coders

Welcome to **Hangman for Coders**, a fun twist on the classic Hangman game — this time with all tech and programming-related words! This Python terminal game is perfect for coders in my opinion who want a little break while staying in their zone. 😎

## 📌 Features

- ASCII art hangman visuals
- A large list of coding-related words
- Tracks your correct and incorrect guesses
- User-friendly interface in the terminal
- Created with beginner-friendly Python

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Run the game in your Python environment.
2. A random coding-related word will be selected.
3. Guess one letter at a time.
4. Each wrong guess brings the hangman closer to completion.
5. Guess the full word before the hangman is complete — or lose the game.

I'm really proud of this project and can't wait to code and share more.
